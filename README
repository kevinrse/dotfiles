~/dotfiles is the place for dotfiles I want to sync across machines.

Baseline files (shared across all machines) go here

machine-specific files go in their own folder (neurofunk, microfunk, hypocentre)

SECURE folder should contain files that contain credentials that can't be made public.

setup_dotfile_symlinks.sh is as the name implies. Keep this up to date so it's easier to set up new machines in future.
